BREAKOUT!!

Destroy all the bricks to win!

Rules and Controls:

1) A and D move the platform left and right
2) Space to launch the ball
3) You lose if you miss the ball
4) The top 2 rows of bricks require 2 hits to break

Notes:

1) Because of the random nature of the ball launch, there is a chance that the ball appears to not move (the velocity is really small), please restart if this happens.
